  <h4> Life at SUNY Buffalo State / Department of Sociology </h4>
  <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
    <em>Hello Everyone, My name is Malcolm Lynch, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, and I live with my two sisters and mother. Out of the three siblings I am the youngest. My twin is older than me by a minute. Funny right! In May of 2019, I graduated
      from
      SUNY Buffalo State College with a bachelor degree in sociology. What influenced me to study sociology furthermore is when attending to my roommates intro to sociology. The professor brought back some flashbacks into my head about how sociology
      is
      a program that helps individuals study the real world, how to use different theories to help with research methods, most important just to understand human behavior. Throughout life itself. Learning about others and trying to understand others
      about what their life is like, what kind of background impacts their life itself. With sociology you can travel and meet others. That's basically how my life was in school. Traveling, interacting with others, competing, and just getting the
      experiences. My top three sociologists are Karl Marx; where he came up with a theory called the “Conflict Theory” which focuses on capitalist societies and the separating the social classes. Second sociologist W.E.B Du Bois was a black
      nationalist that believed that every African should help one another with the same struggles to overcome them as one. He knew every individual struggled to have their own freedom. Final sociologist is Emile Durkheim. Durkheim himself focused on
      the structure of society. For example what makes a society? What values Society has? Just studying the norms and values. Just living in Buffalo for a bit; made me grow as an individual. As of now the volunteer/jobs I've participated in; dealt
      with kids and teenagers that need accommodation with different materials to focus and also help with future goals. Mainly a second family. The names of these organisations are called Go projects and HEAF ( Harlem Educational Activities Fund
      ).</em>
